#About this repository
The original code was taken from "https://github.com/adeept/Adeept_RFID_Learning_Kit_Python_Code_for_RPi", it is written in Python and intended to be run on Raspberry Pi

As I have bought the kit, and came accross the codes I found some mistakes and incomplete codes and description, so I have made additions and modifications to some files, plus adding circuit wiring and desciption that was missing in the original copy

That's why I will keep their original README content here
